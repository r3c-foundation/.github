# 🏛️ R3C Foundation

### “From C to Rust to ASM — Building the Post-LLVM Era.”

The **R3C Foundation** is a long-term open ecosystem dedicated to sustainable compiler technology.  
We focus on **LLVM-free**, **self-hosting**, and **cross-language** compiler pipelines for the next generation of C, C++, and Rust development.

---

### 🌍 Our Vision
- **Independence** — Compilers that breathe on their own, free from centralized dependencies.  
- **Transparency** — Fully auditable toolchains using CMake + Git philosophy.  
- **Longevity** — Sustained for decades through LTSS (Long-Term Sustain System).
