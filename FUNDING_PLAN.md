# 💰 R3C Foundation Funding & Sustainability Plan

## Purpose
Ensure R3C Foundation remains open, independent, and financially sustainable without corporate capture.

## 1. Current Phase (2025–2026)
**Status:** Pre-foundation, education-phase stewardship.  
Funding Source: Personal time + open contributions.  
Main focus:
- Codebase automation and stability  
- Documentation expansion  
- Building community engagement  

---

## 2. Transition Phase (2027–2028)
**Goal:** Formalize the foundation and attract public + institutional support.

Planned actions:
- Establish a non-profit registration (Korea-based or global open-tech jurisdiction)
- Open donation channels (GitHub Sponsors, OpenCollective)
- Introduce “Industrial LTSS Tier” — paid support for companies needing long-term compiler stability
- Collaboration proposals with universities and embedded labs

---

## 3. Long-Term Phase (Post-2029)
**Goal:** Fully autonomous compiler foundation.  

Funding model:
| Source | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Industrial LTSS contracts | Long-term compiler support for embedded + industrial clients |
| Educational partnerships | Open curriculum with universities and research institutes |
| Research grants | Compiler sovereignty, post-LLVM innovation, sustainable Rust pipelines |
| Community donations | Sponsors supporting independence mission |

## 4. Usage of Funds
- **70%** — Development, maintenance, automation, security review  
- **20%** — Education, documentation, and open seminars

## 5. Commitment
R3C Foundation commits that:
- All funds remain transparent (public ledgers or GitHub-based logs)
- No individual profit distribution
