## 💖 Support R3C Foundation

R3C Foundation is a non-profit open source collective building an LLVM-free, long-term sustainable compiler ecosystem.

Your sponsorships help sustain the **R3C → Rust → ASM** toolchain research and keep the LTSS (Long-Term Sustain System) development moving forward.

> 💡 *All sponsorships are currently held in pending (non-withdrawable) status during foundation setup, ensuring full legal compliance.*

### 🌍 Sponsorship Channels
