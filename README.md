# 🧩 R3C Foundation

Welcome to **R3C Foundation** — the home of the Rust Independence Ecosystem.  
We develop next-generation compiler and tooling stacks that move beyond LLVM dependency.

## 🌍 Vision
> “We are not escaping LLVM — we are transcending it.”

Our mission is to evolve **C, C++ and Rust** into a self-hosting, transparent, and industrially stable toolchain ecosystem.

## 🧱 Core Projects
- **r3c** — C++ → Rust → NASM cross-compiler (LLVM-free)
- **Rust-LTSS** — Rust Long-Term Sustain System
- **LLVM-Zero-Ecosystem** — Beyond-LLVM research framework
- **cpppm** — C++ Package Manager inspired by Cargo
- **R3C-Nightly-LTSS** — Experimental releases and CI auto-builds

## 🧠 Philosophy
> “Transparency, sovereignty, and simplicity — the compiler must learn to breathe on its own.”
