# 🗺️ R3C Ecosystem Roadmap (2025–2030)

> **Mission:** Rewrite the base. Build compilers that heal themselves.  
> From C → Rust → ASM — independent, transparent, and sustainable.

---

## 🌱 2025 — Foundation & Independence
**Goal:** Establish LLVM-Zero foundation and core self-hosting toolchain.

| Project | Objective | Status |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **R3C** | LLVM-free C++ → Rust → NASM transpiler | ✅ Stable Final v4 released |
| **Rust-LTSS** | Long-Term Sustain Support for Rust core | 🧩 Active development |
| **R3C-Foundation** | Governance, funding, manifesto setup | 🧱 In progress |
| **Beyond-LLVM** | Research archive for post-LLVM methods | 🌐 Draft phase |

---

## ⚙️ 2026 — Automation & Ecosystem Integration
**Goal:** Expand automation and begin community participation.  
- Full CI/CD self-healing workflows across 3 OS platforms  
- Auto-stable release pipelines  
- Foundation documentation + neutral governance policy

| Project | Key Progress |
|----------|---------------|
| R3C | Self-hosted compilation stage begins |
| Rust-Embedded-LTSS | Launch for industrial ARM / RISC-V targets |
| cpppm | Integration as native C++ package manager |
| Rust-LTSS | Start full MRustC cross-integration test |

---

## 🧩 2027 — Community & Institutional Onboarding
**Goal:** Begin transition to public foundation governance.

- Launch “R3C Academy” documentation portal  
- Invite early university contributors (compiler courses)  
- Start Industrial-LTSS partnership prototype  

| Project | Action |
|----------|--------|
| R3C-Foundation | Legal registration process |
| Rust-LTSS | Formal LTS registry + public audit logs |
| Beyond-LLVM | First whitepaper release (“Post-LLVM Architecture”) |

---

## 🧱 2028 — Industrial LTSS Era
**Goal:** Offer long-term compiler support for embedded & industry.  
- Introduce Industrial LTSS certification  
- Cross-vendor CI validation (Google Cloud, AWS, Azure runners)  
- Expand funding channels (OpenCollective, GitHub Sponsors)

| Project | Deliverable |
|----------|-------------|
| R3C | Cross-compiled targets verified |
| Rust-LTSS | 10-year LTS branch established |
| Embedded-LTSS | Production testbed deployed |

---

## 🌐 2029–2030 — Full Autonomy & Research Frontier
**Goal:** Complete compiler sovereignty.  
Move from *LLVM-Zero* → *Post-LLVM* → *Self-Evolving Compiler Stack.*

| Project | Vision |
|----------|--------|
| R3C | Self-rebuilding bootstrap compiler |
| Post-R3C | Research-grade hybrid C/Rust meta-compiler |
| Beyond-LLVM | Open whitepapers + collaboration with academia |
| Foundation | Sustainable neutral governance under global advisory board |

---

## 🔖 Summary
R3C Foundation’s long-term goal is **compiler sovereignty** —  
a world where open compilers evolve independently of corporate or LLVM control.

> **“Language is temporary. Independence is forever.”**
