# 🌍 R3C Foundation Manifesto  
**Rewrite the base. Build compilers that heal themselves.**  
C++ → Rust → NASM — Cross-Layer Independence Compiler Ecosystem  

---

## 🧭 Vision — Beyond LLVM
R3C Foundation’s vision is simple and direct:

> To make compilers independent, sustainable, and self-evolving.  

We pursue a future where languages and toolchains can live beyond  
corporate dependencies, version instability, and hidden infrastructures.  

Rust, C++, and Assembly can coexist — not through central control,  
but through open modular design and compiler sovereignty.

---

## ⚙️ Core Principles

### 1. **Independence**
R3C rejects forced dependency on LLVM or any singular backend.
Every language deserves a self-sufficient compiler path — free, open, and stable.

### 2. **Sustainability**
We design long-term maintainable toolchains (LTSS)  
for industrial, embedded, and educational use — not short-term hype.

### 3. **Transparency**
Every build, release, and pipeline in R3C is automated, traceable, and reproducible.  
Trust is built through open CI/CD and verifiable compiler behavior.

### 4. **Neutrality**
R3C is not anti-LLVM or anti-Rust.  
We aim for architectural independence — a structure that can coexist, not compete.

## 🧩 Ecosystem Direction
R3C Foundation maintains and evolves the following sub-projects:

| Project | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **R3C Core** | Main cross-platform compiler pipeline (C++ → Rust → NASM) |
| **Rust-LTSS** | Long-term stable Rust ecosystem without LLVM lock-in |
| **Rust-Embedded-LTSS** | Industrial embedded Rust sustain support |
| **Beyond-LLVM** | Research on post-LLVM compilation layers |
| **Post-R3C** | Meta-compiler and education-oriented evolution project |

Each project is part of the R3C Ecosystem — collectively supporting compiler autonomy.

---

## 🧱 Governance Direction
Until formal foundation incorporation, R3C is guided by:
- Transparent public repositories under `r3c-foundation`
- Automated workflows for all builds and releases
- Neutral decision process via open issues and discussions
- Future governance charter planned for 2027-2028 (post-education phase)

---

## 💡 Long-Term Goal
R3C Foundation will evolve into a formal, independent compiler foundation:  
non-profit, educational, and open to industrial cooperation.

Our timeline:
- **2025-2026:** Ecosystem stabilization and automation  
- **2027-2028:** Foundation registration, partnership onboarding  
- **2029+ :** Full independence and industrial LTSS certification  

---

## 🕊️ Declaration
R3C is not owned — it is *stewarded*.  
It belongs to every developer who believes compilers can heal, rebuild, and last.

**Rewrite the base. Build compilers that heal themselves.**
