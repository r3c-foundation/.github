# 🏛️ R3C Foundation Governance Policy

## Purpose
This document defines how R3C Foundation is maintained, directed, and safeguarded.

The purpose is simple:
> Ensure that no individual, company, or external dependency can control or compromise the independence of the R3C ecosystem.

---

## 1. Governance Structure

| Role | Responsibility | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Founder / Steward** | Defines long-term direction and approves major roadmap changes | Currently maintained by the primary maintainer |
| **Core Maintainers** | Manage subprojects (R3C Core, Rust-LTSS, Embedded-LTSS, etc.) | Selected by contribution and proven reliability |
| **Contributors** | Submit PRs, issues, and research inputs | Open participation encouraged |
| **Advisors (Future)** | External experts for industrial or academic review | Post-2027 phase |

---

## 2. Decision Process
- Technical proposals and roadmap items must go through **public GitHub discussions**.  
- Core maintainers vote by consensus; ties resolved by steward decision.
- All workflow changes and release automations are version-controlled under `.github/workflows/`.

---

## 3. Transparency Policy
- All releases must be **automated, traceable, and signed**.  
- No hidden binaries or private dependencies allowed.
- CI/CD logs and build matrices remain fully public.

---

## 4. Conflict of Interest
- Members must disclose external affiliations (companies, research labs, or sponsors).
- R3C prohibits use for closed-source military or surveillance applications.

---

## 5. Future Governance Expansion
Timeline projection:
- **2027** — Community steering committee proposal  
- **2028-2029** — Legal registration as a non-profit entity  
- **Post-2029** — Advisory board with academic + industrial representation  

---

**R3C Foundation — Open by design, governed by neutrality.**
